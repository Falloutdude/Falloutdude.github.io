## Fallout 4 ( 3 major tips )
These Fallout 4 tips are going to be handy if you're about to set off into its huge radioactive open world. There's a lot to see and do, and a lot to learn. You can do it the hard way - by trial and error, or you can use these tips to let you in on the things you need to know.
### 1. Collect everything for crafting and tag resources to find what you need
Crafting has been expanded massively in Fallout 4. As well as potentially taking up hours of your time as you tinker and experiment with the literally thousands of different options at your disposal. All the junk you pick up is made up of component parts that can be put to better use for upgrading armour, modifying weapons and so forth. Clipboards, tin cans, desk fans - everything has a hidden value. You should always check your workbenches to see what components you're missing for whatever it is you're looking to build and then use the 'Tag for Search' function. From then on, your PipBoy will conveniently highlight those components when you're looting, so you can quickly and easily grab the things you need for your upgrades. But do remember to untag things once you've found enough, otherwise you'll end up searching for everything, all the time, forever.

### 2. Use Workbenches to scrap and build bigger things at settlements
Certain items like tires or sinks can only be harvested when you're in an area close to a workbench, like the Red Rocket gas station or the town of Sanctuary. At these locations you you can scrap trees, cars, traffic pylons, street lamps, mailboxes, ruined houses. All of which gets broken into its components and stored in your workbenches. Each workbench in an area shares all of its stuff with every other workbench in that area, so just dump the junk you've gathered from the wasteland into whatever bench is most convenient.But be aware that only the benches in a single settlement share resources, so if you want to use all the steel you gathered at the Starlight Drive-In to make houses in Sanctuary, you're going to have to pick it up and move it. Pretty much everything is good for something, but you may want to peruse your construction options to see what elements you need most. (Go for the ceramic and copper. Trust me.)

### 3.  Use Perks to make the most of your modding
Modding your weapons and armour is just one part of crafting, and it's a fantastic - albeit time-consuming - way to keep your guns up to scratch as you come up against tougher foes. You can also tweak guns to fit other purposes, adding scopes to pistols, or attaching scattered barrels to laser rifles to turn them into laser shotguns.
In order to get the best available from quite early on, you should invest in the mod specific perks that open up later ranks for you to play around with - there are separate ones for melee weapons and firearms. You'll still need to find the necessary components to build these mods, so it's not a easy win when it comes to arming yourself to the

### 4. Choose the right companion for the job and remember where you sent them
There are several companions in Fallout 4, all with different skills, strengths and weaknesses to use. The most obvious is your faithful canine, Dogmeat, who's great for searching abandoned buildings for good treasure, and robot butler Codsworth is not only hilarious but pretty decent in battle and really rather durable. You can talk to them, find out about their history, and even unlock unique companion quests when you reach certain affinities with them. 
But it can be quite difficult to keep a track of where they are, as the game doesn't have a companion screen to see exactly where they're at. Keep close track of them, and when you dismiss them from your service to go back to one of your settlements, try to remember where you sent them. For ease, I used Sanctuary Hills as my main hub of operations - in fact this is smart advice in general; it's much easier to keep track of all your gear, companions and components if you store it in a central location - but still came into trouble a couple of times. If this should become an issue for you, just wait or sleep for 24-hours and you should find your companions hanging around. Remember: when you dismiss a companion to a settlement, they walk there - they don't fast travel!

## Know the 4 major Faction in Fallout Universe
![alt text](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xan924r7ubs/maxresdefault.jpg)
# 1. Minuteman
 The Minutemen are a faction in Fallout 4 dedicated to the defense of human beings in The Commonwealth. At the beginning of the game, the Minutemen are a depleted reserve tarnished by their failure to defend Settlers at the Battle of Quincy.
 The Commonwealth Minutemen are a volunteer civilian defense militia, described as citizen soldiers banding together to protect themselves and their communities.[1] Similar to the Minutemen of the Revolutionary era, the modern day group is focused on defending the people of Massachusetts, at a minute's notice.[2][3] A statue near the Old North Bridge commemorates the original group, standing where the first shots of the Revolutionary War were fired.[4]
The group first rose to prominence in 2180, when they defended Diamond City against a super mutant attack.[5] The Minutemen then attempted to branch out to organize a provisional government with regional settlements.[6] This effort was cut short when group members were murdered by the Institute's representative, a synth.[7] Meanwhile, the group established its headquarters at Fort Independence in South Boston, referring to it as "the Castle."[8] The group including Ronnie Shaw established an armory within the facility, guarded by a sentry bot named Sarge.[9] They maintained operations from this location until 2240, while under the leadership of General McGann, the headquarters was destroyed by a creature that emerged from the surrounding ocean.

# 2. Brotherhood Of Steel
 The Brotherhood of Steel in the Commonwealth is a division of the wider Brotherhood of Steel led by Elder Arthur Maxson.[1] Formed from the reunification of the Brotherhood Outcasts and the Capital Wasteland chapter, they operate from a mobile command airship known as the Prydwen.Arthur Maxson was appointed elder at age 16, the youngest in Brotherhood history, after displaying skill as a warrior and diplomat by defeating the super mutant leader Shepherd and brokering peace with the Brotherhood Outcasts. The group began construction of an airship called the Prydwen, using parts from the Enclave mobile crawler at Adams Air Force Base. The development and construction process took a total of six years.The Brotherhood sent three scout missions into the Commonwealth. First, an unnamed recon squad volunteered to go into the Commonwealth, then Recon Squad Artemis led by Paladin Brandis and Recon Squad Gladius led by Paladin Danse. The first scout team was successful. They brought back crates full of pre-War echnology and documents and the first post-War reconnaissance of the area.Artemis had problems beginning at their drop-off point in Malden. Ambushed by Gunners straight off the Vertibird, which resulted in abandoning and manually shorting out their power armor and the deaths of four knights. The survivors made their way to the National Guard training yard to regroup, which was infested with feral ghouls and resulted in the death of another knight. Brandis and his scribe left to investigate the pre-War Revere satellite array, but super mutants overcame them and claimed the second last member of the team. The only survivor was the commanding officer, Paladin Brandis, who made his way to a pre-War nuclear bunker and took shelter.[2]

# 3. Institute
The Institute is an advanced technocractic scientific cabal based in the Commonwealth. Founded in 2110 by survivors from the Commonwealth Institute of Technology and their descendants, the Institute considers itself a bastion of knowledge and prosperity amid a dying world, and by 2287 has developed numerous revolutionary technologies such as teleportation and synthetic humans.The Institute was built upon what was once known as the Commonwealth Institute of Technology, or C.I.T.[2] While the college itself laid in ruins for more than two centuries, at the time of the Great War, those present took refuge underground.[2] The Institute was formally founded by the children of the original survivors, who dug into the earth and built increasingly sophisticated residential facilities and laboratories, starting an ongoing process of infrastructure expansion.[3]Isolated from the outside world, the scientists continued their work, disregarding the mayhem and destruction occurring outside of its grounds. As they worked on creating synths, they attempted to work peacefully with the people of the Commonwealth using first generation synths as well as help create a new stabilized government, but mutual mistrust and infighting ended that relationship quickly and they returned to isolation.[4][5] Eventually, the scientists have utterly put ubiquitous pre-War technology to shame,[6] to the point where they believed that wastelanders would be unlikely to understand the sheer scope of the Institute's achievement,[7] such as the creation of the molecular relay (teleporter) in the 2180s,[8] which resulted in the Institute sealing itself off from the surface permanently,[9] and the development of synths. For decades, the first and second generation synths were the most visible part of the Institute's operations, scavenging for materials and performing experiments on the wasteland. The scientists did not concern themselves with the effect their actions had on the surface, sometimes resulting in entire settlements being destroyed.[10][11][12]Disdainful of the outside world, they aim to monitor and control the Commonwealth through both subterfuge and brute force, to ensure their work is not disrupted. This secretive and hostile attitude has turned the Institute into a "boogeyman" in the wasteland, and its presence is a major cause of paranoia for the people of the Commonwealth.[1]

# 4. Railroad
Origins
The Railroad has been in existence since at the least the time of the creation of the first successful Generation-3 synths by Institute scientists around the 2220s.[1] Following the public's discovery of the synths during the Broken Mask incident in Diamond City in 2229, the question if they deserve the same rights as natural humans became a major subject of debate, with frequent bickering between opposing sides. Many people believed that the Institute's synths were mere machines; just another model of advanced robot. Paranoia began to develop as local residents' loved ones vanished overnight and were replaced with artificial clones that eventually malfunctioned and went berserk, as with the case with Mr. Carter. Others, however felt that synths deserved to be free, having being treated as slaves by their creators at the Institute. This is a point that makes some convinced that the synths are worthy of saving. It was from these ideals that the earliest possible incarnation of the Railroad would emerge.[2]
