## Fallout 4 ( 3 major tips )
These Fallout 4 tips are going to be handy if you're about to set off into its huge radioactive open world. There's a lot to see and do, and a lot to learn. You can do it the hard way - by trial and error, or you can use these tips to let you in on the things you need to know.
### 1. Collect everything for crafting and tag resources to find what you need
Crafting has been expanded massively in Fallout 4. As well as potentially taking up hours of your time as you tinker and experiment with the literally thousands of different options at your disposal. All the junk you pick up is made up of component parts that can be put to better use for upgrading armour, modifying weapons and so forth. Clipboards, tin cans, desk fans - everything has a hidden value. You should always check your workbenches to see what components you're missing for whatever it is you're looking to build and then use the 'Tag for Search' function. From then on, your PipBoy will conveniently highlight those components when you're looting, so you can quickly and easily grab the things you need for your upgrades. But do remember to untag things once you've found enough, otherwise you'll end up searching for everything, all the time, forever.

### 2. Use Workbenches to scrap and build bigger things at settlements
Certain items like tires or sinks can only be harvested when you're in an area close to a workbench, like the Red Rocket gas station or the town of Sanctuary. At these locations you you can scrap trees, cars, traffic pylons, street lamps, mailboxes, ruined houses. All of which gets broken into its components and stored in your workbenches. Each workbench in an area shares all of its stuff with every other workbench in that area, so just dump the junk you've gathered from the wasteland into whatever bench is most convenient.But be aware that only the benches in a single settlement share resources, so if you want to use all the steel you gathered at the Starlight Drive-In to make houses in Sanctuary, you're going to have to pick it up and move it. Pretty much everything is good for something, but you may want to peruse your construction options to see what elements you need most. (Go for the ceramic and copper. Trust me.)

### 3.  Use Perks to make the most of your modding
Modding your weapons and armour is just one part of crafting, and it's a fantastic - albeit time-consuming - way to keep your guns up to scratch as you come up against tougher foes. You can also tweak guns to fit other purposes, adding scopes to pistols, or attaching scattered barrels to laser rifles to turn them into laser shotguns.
In order to get the best available from quite early on, you should invest in the mod specific perks that open up later ranks for you to play around with - there are separate ones for melee weapons and firearms. You'll still need to find the necessary components to build these mods, so it's not a easy win when it comes to arming yourself to the

### 4. Choose the right companion for the job and remember where you sent them
There are several companions in Fallout 4, all with different skills, strengths and weaknesses to use. The most obvious is your faithful canine, Dogmeat, who's great for searching abandoned buildings for good treasure, and robot butler Codsworth is not only hilarious but pretty decent in battle and really rather durable. You can talk to them, find out about their history, and even unlock unique companion quests when you reach certain affinities with them. 
But it can be quite difficult to keep a track of where they are, as the game doesn't have a companion screen to see exactly where they're at. Keep close track of them, and when you dismiss them from your service to go back to one of your settlements, try to remember where you sent them. For ease, I used Sanctuary Hills as my main hub of operations - in fact this is smart advice in general; it's much easier to keep track of all your gear, companions and components if you store it in a central location - but still came into trouble a couple of times. If this should become an issue for you, just wait or sleep for 24-hours and you should find your companions hanging around. Remember: when you dismiss a companion to a settlement, they walk there - they don't fast travel!

## Know the 3 major Faction in Fallout Universe

# 1. Minuteman
 The Minutemen are a faction in Fallout 4 dedicated to the defense of human beings in The Commonwealth. At the beginning of the game, the Minutemen are a depleted reserve tarnished by their failure to defend Settlers at the Battle of Quincy.
 The Commonwealth Minutemen are a volunteer civilian defense militia, described as citizen soldiers banding together to protect themselves and their communities.[1] Similar to the Minutemen of the Revolutionary era, the modern day group is focused on defending the people of Massachusetts, at a minute's notice.[2][3] A statue near the Old North Bridge commemorates the original group, standing where the first shots of the Revolutionary War were fired.[4]

The group first rose to prominence in 2180, when they defended Diamond City against a super mutant attack.[5] The Minutemen then attempted to branch out to organize a provisional government with regional settlements.[6] This effort was cut short when group members were murdered by the Institute's representative, a synth.[7] Meanwhile, the group established its headquarters at Fort Independence in South Boston, referring to it as "the Castle."[8] The group including Ronnie Shaw established an armory within the facility, guarded by a sentry bot named Sarge.[9] They maintained operations from this location until 2240, while under the leadership of General McGann, the headquarters was destroyed by a creature that emerged from the surrounding ocean.
